Welcome to NG Creations! The inspiration for this page is
for users to be able to explore custom possibilities for
their special occasions. Based on the requirements to 
construct a page using HTML and CSS and the like
on an area of our choosing.

In this page, you are able to navigate through the use of a navigation bar.
In the "about page", you are also able to navigate by use of hyperlinks, which
direct you to the gallery and the contact page. The gallery contains personal images and ordered with flexbox functions.

Improvements:
1. I would like to be able to custom the fonts a bit more
2. I had a challenging time making the forms box come up 
without having to scroll.
3. Edit the homepage to have more advanced/dynamic features 
(ie:carousel function for images?) 

Note: If you are interested in getting some calligraphy done, 
please do use the contact form; someone will get back to you-- it is linked to formspree. Thanks!
